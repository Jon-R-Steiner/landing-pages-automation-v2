# Non-Functional Requirements Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No vulnerabilities. Server Component with static, trusted data source. No user input or external dependencies."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent performance. Server Component (0 client JS), lazy loading images, width/height attributes prevent CLS. Estimated bundle: ~2KB."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Robust error handling with try/catch in formatDate(). Data validation filters invalid entries. Graceful degradation (returns null if insufficient data)."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation (JSDoc for all helpers). Named constants for business rules. Clear structure. Follows all coding standards."
  accessibility:
    status: PASS
    notes: "WCAG 2.1 AA compliant. Proper ARIA labels on star ratings. Semantic HTML. Alt text on images. Color contrast ≥4.5:1."
  scalability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Static generation at build time. No runtime performance impact. Handles 0-N testimonials gracefully."

# Code Quality Details
code_quality:
  strengths:
    - "Server Component architecture (zero client-side JavaScript)"
    - "TypeScript strict mode compliance (0 errors)"
    - "WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance"
    - "Comprehensive data validation with graceful degradation"
    - "Excellent JSDoc documentation for all helper functions"
    - "Clear separation of concerns and logical component structure"
    - "Named constants for business rules (MAX_WORDS, MIN_TESTIMONIALS, etc.)"
  improvements_applied:
    - "Added width={48}, height={48}, loading='lazy' to images for CLS prevention and performance"
    - "Extracted magic numbers (200, 3, 6) to named constants (MAX_WORDS, MIN_TESTIMONIALS, DISPLAY_COUNT_SMALL, DISPLAY_COUNT_LARGE)"
    - "Updated all references to use named constants for consistency"
  technical_debt:
    - note: "Using array index as key prop (line 66)"
      severity: "low"
      justification: "Acceptable for static content that doesn't reorder. Consider using testimonial.customerName+reviewDate if testimonials become dynamic."

notes: |
  Exemplary implementation demonstrating best practices in:
  - TypeScript strict mode compliance
  - Server Component architecture
  - WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility
  - Performance optimization
  - Code documentation
  - Error handling and data validation

  Minor improvements applied during review enhance performance and maintainability
  without altering behavior. Component is production-ready.

  Expected ESLint warning (native img) is intentional and acceptable due to
  Next.js static export mode which is incompatible with Image component.
