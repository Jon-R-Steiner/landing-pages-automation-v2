# Purpose

This document provides a step-by-step flow diagram showing how all technologies work together across four distinct phases:
1. **Phase 1: Airtable Workflow** - Content creation, AI generation, approval
2. **Phase 2: Export & Deploy** - GitHub Actions export, Git commit, Netlify trigger
3. **Phase 3: Build Phase** (Netlify) - Static site generation
4. **Phase 4: Runtime Phase** (User Browser) - User interaction and conversion

This helps identify any missing tools, validate technology choices, and spot potential integration gaps.
