# Netlify Build Failure: Missing lightningcss Binary

**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Context**: Story 2.1 QA Fixes - PERF-001 Performance Measurement
**Issue**: Netlify deployment failing with exit code 2
**Status**: Root cause identified, fix in progress

---

## Problem Statement

Netlify build fails with error:
```
Failed during stage 'building site': Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2
Cannot find module '../lightningcss.linux-x64-gnu.node'
```

**Impact**: Cannot deploy HeroSection component to production, blocking performance measurement (PERF-001 QA fix).

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Evidence Collected

1. **Local Build (Windows)**: ‚úÖ **SUCCESS**
   ```
   npm run build
   ‚úì Compiled successfully in 1173ms
   ‚úì Generating static pages (5/5)
   ```
   - Uses `lightningcss.win32-x64-msvc.node` binary
   - All pages generate correctly

2. **Netlify Build (Linux)**: ‚ùå **FAILURE**
   - Requires `lightningcss.linux-x64-gnu.node` binary
   - Binary not installed during Netlify build process
   - Build fails with module not found error

3. **Dependency Chain**:
   ```
   @tailwindcss/postcss@4.1.14 (devDependencies)
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ @tailwindcss/node@4.1.14
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lightningcss@1.30.1
           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lightningcss-linux-x64-gnu (optional dependency)
   ```

4. **Platform-Specific Binaries**:
   - Local (Windows): `node_modules/lightningcss-win32-x64-msvc/`
   - Netlify (Linux): Needs `node_modules/lightningcss-linux-x64-gnu/` ‚ùå MISSING

### Why This Happens

**Critical Configuration Error**: Tailwind CSS v4 packages are in `devDependencies`

From `package.json`:
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": "^4.0.0",
    "tailwindcss": "^4.0.0",
    "postcss": "^8.4.0"
  }
}
```

**Problem with devDependencies**:
1. Next.js build process (`npm run build`) requires Tailwind CSS at build time
2. Netlify may skip or optimize installation of devDependencies
3. Optional platform-specific dependencies (like `lightningcss-linux-x64-gnu`) may not install correctly
4. Result: Linux binary missing during Netlify build

### Why Local Build Works

- Windows binary (`lightningcss-win32-x64-msvc`) installs correctly locally
- `npm install` on Windows properly resolves optional dependencies for win32 platform
- Local build uses installed Windows binary successfully

---

## Solution

### Fix: Move CSS Build Dependencies to Production Dependencies

**Rationale**: These packages are required for `next build`, making them true dependencies, not dev-only packages.

### Changes Required

**package.json modifications**:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "airtable": "^0.12.2",
    "next": "^15.5.0",
    "react": "^19.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^19.2.0",
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": "^4.0.0",  // MOVED FROM devDependencies
    "tailwindcss": "^4.0.0",            // MOVED FROM devDependencies
    "postcss": "^8.4.0"                 // MOVED FROM devDependencies
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@dotenvx/dotenvx": "^1.51.0",
    "@types/node": "^20.0.0",
    "@types/react": "^19.0.0",
    "@types/react-dom": "^19.0.0",
    "dotenv": "^17.2.3",
    "eslint": "^8.0.0",
    "eslint-config-next": "^15.5.0",
    "tsx": "^4.20.6",
    "typescript": "^5.9.0"
    // Removed: @tailwindcss/postcss, tailwindcss, postcss
  }
}
```

### Implementation Steps

**Attempt 1: Move CSS packages to dependencies** ‚ùå FAILED
1. ‚úÖ Moved @tailwindcss/postcss, tailwindcss, postcss to dependencies
2. ‚úÖ Ran npm install
3. ‚úÖ Verified local build works
4. ‚úÖ Deployed (commit 5e8c5e3)
5. ‚ùå Still failed - same error "Cannot find module '../lightningcss.linux-x64-gnu.node'"

**Root Cause**: lightningcss-linux-x64-gnu is an **optional dependency** - not guaranteed to install in all environments

**Attempt 2: Add Linux binary as explicit dependency** ‚ùå FAILED
**Aligned with Netlify Recommendation**: "Ensure all JavaScript dependencies are correctly listed in package.json"

1. ‚úÖ Added `lightningcss-linux-x64-gnu@1.30.1` to dependencies (not optional)
2. ‚úÖ Ran npm install --force to update package-lock.json
3. ‚úÖ Verified local build still works
4. ‚úÖ Deployed (commit 203c75d)
5. ‚ùå Still failed - same error "Cannot find module '../lightningcss.linux-x64-gnu.node'"

**User Action**: Disabled Netlify plugins (Lighthouse & Chromium) to simplify troubleshooting

**Attempt 3: Remove --legacy-peer-deps flag** ‚ùå FAILED
**Hypothesis**: The `--legacy-peer-deps` npm flag may interfere with optional dependency resolution

1. ‚úÖ Removed `NPM_FLAGS = "--legacy-peer-deps"` from netlify.toml
2. ‚úÖ Updated scratch documentation with this attempt
3. ‚úÖ Ran npm install (expected EBADPLATFORM error on Windows)
4. ‚úÖ Verified local build still works (compiled successfully in 1138ms)
5. ‚úÖ Deployed (commit 6a1f753)
6. ‚ùå Still failed - same error "Cannot find module '../lightningcss.linux-x64-gnu.node'"

**Deploy Details**:
- Deploy ID: 68efceca1340600008a186ba
- Commit: 6a1f753
- State: error
- Error: "Failed during stage 'building site': Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2"
- Build Time: ~28 seconds (16:41:46 - 16:42:14 UTC)

**Critical Discovery**: Attempt 4 only modified netlify.toml - **package.json/package-lock.json unchanged**. Netlify likely reused cached node_modules from Attempt 3!

**Attempt 5: Add postinstall script + cache bust** ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS
**Strategy**: Multi-pronged approach to force Linux binary installation AND invalidate Netlify cache

1. ‚úÖ Added postinstall script to force lightningcss-linux-x64-gnu installation
   ```json
   "postinstall": "npm install --no-save --force lightningcss-linux-x64-gnu@1.30.1 2>/dev/null || echo 'lightningcss binary install skipped (expected on Windows)'"
   ```
2. ‚úÖ Added `_comment` field to package.json to trigger Netlify cache invalidation
3. ‚úÖ Removed lightningcss-linux-x64-gnu from dependencies (rely on postinstall only)
4. ‚úÖ Ran npm install - postinstall script executed successfully
5. ‚úÖ Verified local build still works (compiled successfully in 1086ms)
6. ‚è≥ Commit and push (will be 5th attempt)
7. ‚è≥ Monitor Netlify build logs
8. ‚è≥ Run Lighthouse on deployed page if successful
9. ‚è≥ Document performance metrics

**Rationale**:
- Netlify invalidates node_modules cache when package.json changes (cache bust)
- postinstall script runs AFTER dependencies install on Netlify's Linux environment
- `--force` bypasses platform checks to download Linux binary
- `--no-save` prevents modifying package.json during build
- `2>/dev/null || echo` makes script non-blocking if it fails

## Analysis After 4 Failed Attempts

### Pattern Recognition

All 4 deployment attempts failed with the **same error**:
```
Cannot find module '../lightningcss.linux-x64-gnu.node'
```

This suggests the issue is **NOT** related to:
- devDependencies vs dependencies placement ‚ùå
- Explicit dependency declaration ‚ùå
- npm flags (--legacy-peer-deps) ‚ùå

### Likely Root Cause

**Tailwind CSS v4 (Beta) + Netlify Incompatibility**

The lightningcss package has platform-specific **optional dependencies**:
- `lightningcss-linux-x64-gnu` for Linux
- `lightningcss-win32-x64-msvc` for Windows
- Other platform variants

**Problem**: Optional dependencies may not install correctly on Netlify's build environment even when:
1. Listed in package.json dependencies
2. Added explicitly as dependencies
3. npm install runs without special flags

**Evidence**:
- Local Windows build: ‚úÖ Works perfectly
- Netlify Linux build: ‚ùå Consistently fails
- Same error across all configuration attempts

### Potential Solutions

**Option 1: Use Netlify Build Plugin for PostCSS** üîç INVESTIGATE
- Check if Netlify has a build plugin that handles PostCSS/Tailwind v4 differently
- May provide better control over dependency installation

**Option 2: Pre-build Approach** üõ†Ô∏è WORKAROUND
- Build locally on Windows
- Upload `out/` directory directly to Netlify
- Bypass Netlify's build process entirely
- **Downside**: Loses continuous deployment automation

**Option 3: Use `postinstall` Script** üîß TRY NEXT
- Add postinstall script to explicitly install Linux binary
- Force npm to download platform-specific package
```json
"scripts": {
  "postinstall": "npm install --no-save lightningcss-linux-x64-gnu || true"
}
```

**Option 4: Investigate Tailwind v4 Beta Netlify Support** üìö RESEARCH
- Search Tailwind CSS v4 beta documentation for Netlify deployment guides
- Check Tailwind CSS GitHub issues for similar problems
- Tailwind v4 is in beta - may have known deployment issues

**Option 5: Contact Netlify Support** üÜò ESCALATE
- This may be a platform-specific issue requiring Netlify engineering input
- Provide deploy logs and configuration details

**Option 6: Downgrade to Tailwind CSS v3** ‚ö†Ô∏è USER REJECTED
- User explicitly said: "do not do this Fallback: Downgrade to Tailwind CSS v3"
- This would resolve the issue but requires significant refactoring
- Deferred unless all other options exhausted

### Recommended Next Step

**Try Option 3**: Add postinstall script to force Linux binary installation

---

## Expected Outcome

### After Fix Applied

‚úÖ Netlify build process will:
1. Install all production dependencies including CSS packages
2. Properly resolve `lightningcss@1.30.1` and its optional dependencies
3. Install `lightningcss-linux-x64-gnu` binary for Linux platform
4. Successfully complete `npm run build`
5. Deploy static site to CDN

### QA Fixes Completion

- ‚úÖ **QUAL-001**: ESLint configured (already complete)
- ‚è≥ **PERF-001**: Performance measurement (unblocked after this fix)
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è **TEST-001**: Automated tests (acknowledged, deferred to Phase 2)

## Notes

- This issue is common when migrating to Tailwind CSS v4 (currently in beta)
- Tailwind v4 uses PostCSS architecture with native CSS tooling (lightningcss)
- Platform-specific binaries require correct npm installation context
- devDependencies vs dependencies matters for build-time tools in CI/CD

**Lesson Learned**: Packages required for production builds should be in `dependencies`, even if they're traditionally considered "dev tools" (CSS processors, compilers, etc.).
