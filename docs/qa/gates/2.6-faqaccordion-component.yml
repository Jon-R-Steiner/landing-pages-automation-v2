# Quality Gate Decision - Story 2.6 FAQAccordion Component
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "2.6"
story_title: "FAQAccordion Component Implementation"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Excellent component implementation with all ACs met and outstanding production metrics (LCP 244ms, CLS 0.00). However, no automated test coverage exists despite story requirements mentioning Playwright visual regression tests. Manual testing was comprehensive but creates technical debt for future changes."
