# Documentation Navigation Guide

Welcome to the Landing Pages Automation v2 documentation! This guide helps you quickly find the information you need in our semantically organized documentation structure.

---

## üìö Documentation Philosophy

Our documentation is organized **by purpose, not by file type**. Instead of one monolithic architecture document, we've sharded content into focused, navigable sections:

- **Why semantic organization?** Easier to find specific information, better for AI agent context loading, and clearer separation of concerns
- **Why sharding?** Large documents become overwhelming; smaller, focused files are faster to read and easier to maintain
- **Result:** 100+ focused documents organized by what you're trying to accomplish

## üó∫Ô∏è Quick Navigation Map

### When to Use Each Documentation Section

| Section | Purpose | You Should Look Here If... |
|---------|---------|----------------------------|
| **[architecture/](architecture/)** | Technical implementation details for developers | You're implementing a feature, need coding standards, tech stack info, or architecture decisions |
| **[workflows/](workflows/)** | Operational processes and procedures | You need to understand how content flows from Airtable to production, or cross-team coordination |
| **[integrations/](integrations/)** | Third-party service integration strategies | You're integrating with Salesforce, Make.com, or other external systems |
| **[diagrams/](diagrams/)** | Visual system overviews and flow charts | You want a high-level visual understanding of the system architecture |

**VS Code / Claude Code:**
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + F` - Search across all files
- `Ctrl/Cmd + P` then type `docs/` - Quick file navigation
- Use specific terms like "error handling", "TypeScript", "deployment"

**Example Searches:**
- "Next.js 15" ‚Üí Find all references to Next.js configuration
- "Airtable API" ‚Üí Find Airtable integration details
- "LCP optimization" ‚Üí Find performance optimization strategies

### Follow the Breadcrumbs

Many documents include "Related Documents" sections at the bottom that link to related topics. Follow these to explore connected information.

### Check Multiple Related Files

Related topics may be split across multiple focused files. For example:
- **Error handling** ‚Üí See `error-handling-principles.md`, `runtime-error-handling.md`, `build-time-error-handling.md`
- **Performance** ‚Üí See `performance-optimization.md`, `performance-monitoring.md`
- **Testing** ‚Üí See `testing-philosophy.md`, `testing-types.md`

## üìù Contributing to Documentation

When updating documentation:

1. **Keep files focused** - Each file should cover one specific topic
2. **Update related documents** - If you change architecture, update dependent docs
3. **Add cross-references** - Link to related documents in "Related Documents" sections
4. **Follow semantic organization** - Place documents in the appropriate folder (architecture/workflows/integrations/diagrams)
5. **Update this guide** - If you add major new sections, update this README
