# Technical Summary

Landing Pages Automation v2 is a **Jamstack application** built with **Next.js 15 App Router in static export mode** (`output: 'export'`), deployed to **Netlify CDN** for global edge distribution. The system uses an **Airtable-centric workflow** where Marketing creates pages in Airtable, triggers AI content generation via **Netlify Functions** (serverless) that call **Claude API** to generate Hero, Trust Bar, Gallery, and FAQ content and write it back to Airtable for review and approval. Once approved, **GitHub Actions** exports all content (including AI-generated) to a single `content.json` file, which Next.js uses at build time to generate 500+ static pages. At runtime, static pages load instantly from CDN (<50ms globally), achieving **LCP <2.5s** through critical CSS inlining, self-hosted fonts (WOFF2), build-time image optimization (AVIF/WebP), and deferred third-party scripts (`strategy="lazyOnload"`). Client-side hydration enables interactive **3-stage progressive forms** that submit to **Make.com webhooks** for **Salesforce lead creation** via OAuth 2. Conversion tracking is handled by **GTM, CallRail, and GA4** with all scripts loaded post-LCP to preserve sub-2.5s targets critical for Google Ads Quality Score.

This architecture achieves PRD goals through **performance** (static CDN + aggressive optimization = 0.8-2.0s LCP), **scalability** (proven Next.js 15 static export handles 5000+ pages), **maintainability** (flat structure, clear separation of concerns), and **cost efficiency** (~$20-30/month total, leveraging free tiers: Netlify 100GB bandwidth, 300 build mins/mo, Netlify Functions 125K requests/mo for backend workflows).
