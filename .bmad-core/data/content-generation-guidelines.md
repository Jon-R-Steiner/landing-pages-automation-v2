## Core Copywriting Principles

### 1. Conversion-First Mindset

**Every word should drive action.**

- Primary goal: Get prospect to call, fill form, request quote
- Secondary goal: Build trust that leads to eventual conversion
- Tertiary goal: Inform and educate

**Conversion Hierarchy:**
1. **Call** - Highest intent, immediate contact
2. **Form Fill** - High intent, requires follow-up
3. **Quote Request** - Consideration stage
4. **Learn More** - Lower intent, nurture needed

### 2. Local SEO Optimization

**Target:** Local service searches (e.g., "bathroom remodeling austin tx")

**Key Elements:**
- Service name + Location in H1, Title, and Description
- City/State mentioned naturally throughout content
- Local trust signals (years in area, local customers served)
- Neighborhood references when appropriate

**Natural Integration:**
✅ "Austin's most trusted bathroom remodeling experts"
✅ "Serving Austin homeowners for 25+ years"
✅ "Over 5,000 satisfied customers across Austin"

❌ "Austin bathroom remodeling Austin TX Austin"
❌ Keyword stuffing that sounds unnatural

### 3. Trust Through Specificity

**Generic claims don't convert. Specific proof does.**

**Examples:**

| ❌ Generic | ✅ Specific |
|-----------|------------|
| "Quality work" | "Lifetime workmanship warranty" |
| "Experienced team" | "25+ years serving Austin" |
| "Great reviews" | "4.9/5 stars from 2,847 customers" |
| "Fast service" | "2-4 week average completion" |
| "Licensed professionals" | "Licensed since 1998, A+ BBB rated" |

### 4. Benefit Over Features

**Customers don't buy features. They buy outcomes.**

**Feature → Benefit Translation:**

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| "We use premium materials" | "Enjoy a bathroom that lasts 20+ years" |
| "Certified installers" | "Rest easy knowing licensed experts handle every detail" |
| "Free estimates" | "Get a no-pressure quote to plan your budget" |
| "Flexible scheduling" | "Schedule around your busy life with evening and weekend appointments" |

**Formula:** Feature + "which means" + Customer Benefit

### 5. Authentic Voice

**Avoid corporate jargon. Write like a helpful local expert.**

| ❌ Corporate Jargon | ✅ Authentic Voice |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| "We leverage synergistic solutions" | "We work with you to create the perfect bathroom" |
| "Maximizing ROI through value-added services" | "Get the most value for your budget" |
| "Your one-stop shop for all your needs" | "We handle everything from design to cleanup" |
| "Going the extra mile for customer satisfaction" | "We're not done until you love your new bathroom" |

## Google Ads Quality Score Optimization

**For paid traffic pages, message match is critical.**

### Message Match Requirements

**Ad copy** and **landing page copy** must align:

```

**Landing Page H1:**
```

**Landing Page SEO Title:**
```

```

**Key Alignment:**
- Same service terminology
- Same location format
- Same offer (Free Quote)
- Same trust signals (A+ Rating)

### Quality Score Components Affected by Copy

1. **Ad Relevance** - Keywords in ad match keywords on page
2. **Expected CTR** - Compelling meta description improves CTR
