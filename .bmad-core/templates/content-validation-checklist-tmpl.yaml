# Validation Scoring:
# - All "critical: true" items must pass
# - "critical: false" items are recommended but optional
# - If any critical check fails, content should be regenerated

# Usage:
# 1. After generating all content, run through this checklist
# 2. Mark each check as pass/fail
# 3. If critical checks fail, regenerate that section
# 4. Once all critical checks pass, proceed to write to Airtable
