# Airtable Automation Script: Smart Branch Matching

**Script File:** `scripts/Airtable/airtable-automation-match-branch.js`
**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-11
**Status:** ‚úÖ Production Ready

---

## Overview

This automation script intelligently matches Pages to the correct Branch Location based on geographic Service Areas. It features self-healing logic that automatically corrects mismatches and prevents unnecessary updates.

### Key Benefits

- **üîÑ Self-Healing:** Automatically detects and fixes incorrect branch assignments
- **‚ö° Efficient:** Only updates when necessary (prevents infinite automation loops)
- **üéØ Smart Fallback:** Uses Service Areas first, falls back to client default branch
- **üìã Actionable Errors:** Provides clear error messages with troubleshooting steps
- **üîç Comprehensive Logging:** Detailed console output for debugging

---

## How It Works

### Trigger
**When:** A record in the **Pages** table is updated
**Conditions:** Any field change (script validates internally)

### Logic Flow

```
1. INPUT VALIDATION
   ‚îú‚îÄ Check recordId exists
   ‚îî‚îÄ Check required fields (Client Name, Location ID)

2. LOOKUP CORRECT BRANCH
   ‚îú‚îÄ Priority 1: Match via Service Areas (location-based)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Priority 2: Use client's default branch (alphabetically first)

3. COMPARE
   ‚îú‚îÄ Get current Matched Branch
   ‚îú‚îÄ Compare with correct branch
   ‚îî‚îÄ Determine if update needed

4. UPDATE (if needed)
   ‚îú‚îÄ Set Matched Branch field
   ‚îú‚îÄ Add warning note (if using fallback)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Set output variables for next automation step
```

### Matching Logic

#### Priority 1: Service Area Match
- Looks up Service Areas table for active entry matching the Page's Location ID
- Uses the Branch ID from the matching Service Area
- **Example:** Page for "Cleveland" ‚Üí Service Area for "Cleveland" ‚Üí "Cleveland Office"

#### Priority 2: Default Branch Fallback
- If no Service Area exists, finds first active branch for the client (alphabetically)
- Adds warning note to Page record
- **Example:** No Service Area for "Akron" ‚Üí Uses "Cleveland Office" (client's first branch)

#### Error Handling
- If no active branches exist for client ‚Üí Error note added, automation fails gracefully

## Input Variables

The automation must be configured with the following input variable:

| Name | Type | Value | Required |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| `recordId` | String | `[Trigger] Record ID` | ‚úÖ Yes |

### Configuration Steps:
1. Edit automation
2. Go to "Run script" action
3. Click "+ Add input variable"
4. Name: `recordId`
5. Value: Select "Record ID" from trigger dropdown

---

## Output Variables

The script sets these output variables for use in subsequent automation steps:

| Variable | Type | Values | Description |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| `result` | String | `"updated"`, `"no_change"`, `"skipped"`, `"error"` | Overall result status |
| `message` | String | Descriptive text | Human-readable result message |
| `matchSource` | String | `"service_area"`, `"default_branch"` | How the branch was matched (only on success) |

### Usage in Next Action:
```
Conditional Logic:
- If [Run script] result equals "updated" ‚Üí Send notification
- If [Run script] result equals "error" ‚Üí Alert admin
```

## Field Requirements

### Required Fields (Pages Table)
- ‚úÖ **Client Name** (Linked Record) - Must be populated
- ‚úÖ **Location ID** (Linked Record) - Must be populated for local pages
- ‚úÖ **Matched Branch** (Linked Record) - Updated by script

### Optional Fields (Pages Table)
- **Notes** (Long Text) - Script adds warnings/errors here

### Related Tables
- **Service Areas** - Active service area definitions (Branch + Location mapping)
- **Branch Locations** - Active branch records for each client

---

## Test Scenarios

### ‚úÖ Test 1: Happy Path (Service Area Match)
**Setup:**
- Page with Client + Location
- Service Area exists for that Location + Client

**Expected Result:**
- Matched Branch set correctly
- Output: `result: "updated"` or `"no_change"` (if already correct)
- Console: "‚úÖ Found Service Area match: [Branch Name]"

---

### ‚úÖ Test 2: Fallback to Default Branch
**Setup:**
- Page with Client + Location
- NO Service Area for that Location

**Expected Result:**
- Matched Branch set to client's first alphabetical branch
- Warning note added to Notes field
- Output: `result: "updated"`, `matchSource: "default_branch"`
- Console: "‚ö†Ô∏è Using default branch: [Branch Name]"

---

### ‚úÖ Test 3: Already Correct (No Update)
**Setup:**
- Page with correct Matched Branch already set

**Expected Result:**
- No update performed (efficiency!)
- Output: `result: "no_change"`
- Console: "‚è≠Ô∏è NO UPDATE NEEDED: Matched Branch is already correct"

---

### ‚úÖ Test 4: Empty Matched Branch (Needs Update)
**Setup:**
- Page with no Matched Branch set

**Expected Result:**
- Matched Branch populated
- Output: `result: "updated"`
- Console: "‚úÖ UPDATE NEEDED: Matched Branch is empty"

---

### ‚úÖ Test 5: Wrong Matched Branch (Auto-Fix)
**Setup:**
- Page with incorrect Matched Branch

**Expected Result:**
- Matched Branch corrected
- Output: `result: "updated"`
- Console: "‚úÖ UPDATE NEEDED: Matched Branch is incorrect"

---

### ‚úÖ Test 6: Validation Skip (Empty Location)
**Setup:**
- Page with empty Location ID

**Expected Result:**
- No update performed
- Output: `result: "skipped"`, `message: "Location ID is empty"`
- Console: "‚è≠Ô∏è SKIP: Location ID is empty"

---

### ‚úÖ Test 7: Error (No Branches Exist)
**Setup:**
- Client with NO active branches in Branch Locations table

**Expected Result:**
- Error note added to Page Notes field
- Output: `result: "error"`, `message: "No branches exist for client"`
- Console: "‚ùå ERROR: No active branches exist for this client!"

## Error Handling

### Input Validation Error
**Cause:** Missing `recordId` input variable

**Console Output:**
```
‚ùå ERROR: recordId input variable not provided
üìã ACTION REQUIRED:
   1. Edit this automation
   2. Go to 'Run script' action
   3. Click '+ Add input variable'
   4. Variable name: recordId
   5. Value: Select 'Record ID' from trigger
```

**Resolution:** Follow the instructions to configure input variable

---

### No Branches Error
**Cause:** Client has no active branches in Branch Locations table

**Console Output:**
```
‚ùå ERROR: No active branches exist for this client!
```

**Result:**
- Error note added to Page Notes field
- Output: `result: "error"`

**Resolution:** Create at least one active branch for the client in Branch Locations table

---

## Performance

### Execution Time
- **Typical:** 2-5 seconds
- **Maximum:** <30 seconds (well under 120s timeout)

### Optimization Features
- Fetches only needed fields (not entire records)
- Early returns for validation (skips unnecessary processing)
- Conditional updates (only when branch changes)
- Parallel table fetching (when possible)

---

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do's
- ‚úÖ Ensure Service Areas are kept up-to-date
- ‚úÖ Monitor automation run history for errors
- ‚úÖ Test with sample records before production
- ‚úÖ Keep at least one active branch per client

### ‚ùå Don'ts
- ‚ùå Don't manually trigger on ALL records at once (rate limits)
- ‚ùå Don't delete branches that have matched pages
- ‚ùå Don't modify script without testing
- ‚ùå Don't remove input variable configuration

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Script fails with "recordId is undefined"
**Cause:** Input variable not configured
**Fix:** Add `recordId` input variable (see Input Variables section)

### Issue: Script always uses default branch
**Cause:** Service Areas table missing entries
**Fix:** Add Service Area records for each Location + Branch combination

### Issue: Script updates every time (infinite loop)
**Cause:** Branch comparison logic failing
**Fix:** Check that Matched Branch field is linked to correct table

### Issue: Timeout error
**Cause:** Too many records or complex queries
**Fix:** Reduce number of fields fetched, optimize Service Areas table

---

## Maintenance

### When to Update Script

1. **New field requirements** - If additional fields need to be updated
2. **Logic changes** - If matching rules change
3. **Performance issues** - If execution time increases
4. **Bug fixes** - If edge cases discovered
