## High-Risk Area Analysis

### RISK-001: AI Content Generation + TCPA Compliance ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Description:**
Claude API generates all landing page content. TCPA-compliant disclaimers MUST be present in all pages with contact forms/phone numbers, or client faces legal liability.

**Failure Scenarios:**
- AI generates content without required TCPA language
- TCPA language present but formatted incorrectly (not legally valid)
- Inconsistent compliance across 500-page batch
- AI prompt changes break compliance validation

**Business Impact:**
- **Legal Risk:** TCPA violations = $500-1,500 per violation × potentially thousands of leads
- **Client Reputation:** Immediate project termination, potential lawsuits
- **System Credibility:** Single compliance failure destroys AI generation trust

**Test Strategy:**

**Unit Tests:**
- TCPA keyword detection validation function
- Content structure parser (verify footer contains disclaimer)
- Regex pattern matching for required legal phrases

**Integration Tests:**
- Claude API response → Airtable storage → TCPA validation pipeline
- Batch validation: All 500 pages pass compliance check
- Negative testing: Intentionally malformed content triggers validation failure

**E2E Tests:**
- Sample 20 random pages from deployed batch
- Automated scan for TCPA keywords in rendered HTML
- Manual legal review of 5 random pages per batch (spot-check)

**Quality Gates:**
- **MANDATORY:** 100% TCPA compliance (no exceptions, no waivers)
- Automated validation MUST run on every build before deployment
- Failed validation MUST block deployment

**Testability Requirements:**
- Expose TCPA validation function for isolated testing
- Log all validation results (pass/fail per page) to `docs/qa/compliance-logs/`
- Create test fixtures: valid content, missing disclaimer, malformed disclaimer

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Validate Epic 1 AI prompts include explicit TCPA instructions
- Double validation: AI generation + build-time HTML scan
- Human spot-check of 10% random sample per batch

---

### RISK-002: Build-Time Airtable Integration ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Description:**
Next.js fetches all page content from Airtable API during static build. API failures = zero pages deployed.

**Failure Scenarios:**
- Airtable API rate limit exceeded (5 req/sec per base)
- API timeout during 500-page fetch
- Network failures during build (Netlify → Airtable)
- Schema mismatch (Airtable field changes break Next.js parsing)
- Authentication failures (API key expired/invalid)

**Business Impact:**
- **Deployment Blocker:** No pages deployed if API fails
- **Time Loss:** 10-15 min build time wasted on failures
- **Client Impact:** Delayed launches, missed campaign deadlines

**Test Strategy:**

**Unit Tests:**
- Airtable API client: authenticate, fetch, parse
- Rate limit handler: exponential backoff, retry logic
- Schema validation: verify expected fields present
- Error handling: API failures throw correct error types

**Integration Tests:**
- Fetch 10 pages → Build succeeds
- Fetch 100 pages → Build succeeds, measure time
- Fetch 500 pages → Build succeeds, measure time (scaling validation)
- Simulate API timeout → Retry succeeds
- Simulate rate limit → Backoff + retry succeeds
- Simulate schema mismatch → Build fails with clear error

**E2E Tests:**
- Full build on Netlify with real Airtable data
- Monitor Netlify build logs for API errors
- Verify all 500 pages deployed successfully

**Quality Gates:**
- **MANDATORY:** 95%+ successful build rate (per NFR4)
- Build time <15 minutes for 500 pages (per NFR, PRD)
- Zero unhandled API errors (all errors caught + logged)

**Testability Requirements:**
- Mock Airtable API responses for unit tests
- Create test Airtable base with 500 sample records
- Add build-time logging: API call count, response times, errors
- Expose retry count + backoff metrics in build logs

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Implement circuit breaker pattern (fail fast after 3 consecutive errors)
- Cache Airtable responses during build (reduce redundant API calls)
- Pre-build validation: Ping Airtable API before triggering Netlify build
- Epic 6 multi-tier validation explicitly tests 10 → 100 → 500 page scaling
