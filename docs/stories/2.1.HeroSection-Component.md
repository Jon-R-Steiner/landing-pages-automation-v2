## Dev Notes

### Component Location

**File Structure:**
```
src/components/HeroSection/
├── HeroSection.tsx          # Main component
├── CTAButton.tsx            # Reusable CTA button (if extracted)
└── index.ts                 # Barrel export
```

**Import Path:** `@/components/HeroSection` (via tsconfig.json path alias)

**Integration Point:** `src/app/[service]/[location]/page.tsx` (dynamic route page)

### Data Contract (TypeScript Interfaces)

**HeroData Interface** (from `src/types/content-data.ts`):
```typescript
export interface HeroData {
  h1Headline: string        // Pages.H1 Headline
  subheadline: string       // Pages.Hero Subheadline
  imageUrl: string          // Hero Image.URL lookup
  imageAlt: string          // Hero Image.Alt Text lookup
  primaryCta: CTAAction
  secondaryCta?: CTAAction  // Optional secondary CTA
}

export interface CTAAction {
  text: string                              // CTA.Text lookup
  actionType: 'phone' | 'form' | 'link'     // CTA.Action Type lookup
  actionValue: string                       // CTA.Action Value lookup
}
```

**Branding Interface** (from `src/types/content-data.ts`):
```typescript
export interface BrandingData {
  primaryColor: string    // Client.Primary Color lookup (e.g., "#0ea5e9")
  secondaryColor: string  // Client.Secondary Color lookup (e.g., "#8b5cf6")
  logoUrl: string         // Client.Logo URL lookup
  googleFonts: string     // Client.Google Fonts lookup (e.g., "Inter")
}
```

**Component Props:**
```typescript
interface HeroSectionProps {
  hero: HeroData
  branding: BrandingData
}
```

### Dynamic Branding Implementation

**Approach:** CSS custom properties set via inline styles on root element

**Example:**
```tsx
export default function HeroSection({ hero, branding }: HeroSectionProps) {
  return (
    <section
      className="hero-section"
      style={{
        '--brand-primary': branding.primaryColor,
        '--brand-secondary': branding.secondaryColor,
      } as React.CSSProperties}
    >
      <h1 className="text-[var(--brand-primary)]">{hero.h1Headline}</h1>
      <button className="bg-[var(--brand-primary)]">{hero.primaryCta.text}</button>
    </section>
  )
}
```

### Responsive Design Strategy

**Breakpoints:**
- **320px (base):** Single column, stacked layout (image below text)
- **768px (md:):** Two-column grid (text left, image right)
- **1440px (xl:):** Full-width hero, optimized spacing

**Layout Pattern (Tailwind CSS v4):**
```tsx
<section className="grid grid-cols-1 gap-8 md:grid-cols-2 md:gap-12 xl:gap-16">
  <div>{/* Text content */}</div>
  <div>{/* Hero image */}</div>
</section>
```

**Touch Targets:**
- Minimum 44×44px for CTA buttons (iOS Human Interface Guidelines)
- Use `min-h-[44px] min-w-[44px] px-6 py-3` on buttons

### LCP Optimization

**Critical:** Hero image is the LCP element (largest contentful paint)

**Optimization Techniques:**
1. **Priority Loading:** `<Image priority />` prop (preload hero image)
2. **Image Format:** Next.js automatic AVIF/WebP/JPEG with srcset
3. **Sizing:** Explicit width/height to prevent CLS
4. **Lazy Loading:** Disabled for hero (above-the-fold)

**Target:** LCP <500ms (match Phase 0.2 baseline of 179ms)

**next.config.js Image Configuration:**
```javascript
module.exports = {
  images: {
    formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],
    deviceSizes: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920],
    imageSizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384],
  },
}
```

### CTA Action Types

**Implementation:**
```tsx
function handleCtaClick(cta: CTAAction) {
  switch (cta.actionType) {
    case 'phone':
      window.location.href = `tel:${cta.actionValue}` // e.g., tel:555-123-4567
      break
    case 'form':
      document.querySelector('#contact-form')?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })
      break
    case 'link':
      window.location.href = cta.actionValue // External URL
      break
  }
}
```

### Accessibility Requirements

**WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:**
- ✅ Semantic HTML: `<h1>` for headline, `<p>` for subheadline
- ✅ ARIA labels: `aria-label` on CTA buttons (e.g., "Request a free quote")
- ✅ Keyboard navigation: Buttons accessible via Tab, activated via Enter/Space
- ✅ Color contrast: ≥4.5:1 for text, ≥3:1 for UI components
- ✅ Focus indicators: Visible focus ring on interactive elements

**Screen Reader Support:**
- H1 headline announced first
- Subheadline provides context
- CTA button text describes action clearly

### Testing Standards

**Type Checking:**
```bash
npm run type-check  # TypeScript strict mode (0 errors required)
```

**Linting:**
```bash
npm run lint  # ESLint with Next.js, TypeScript, accessibility rules
```

**Build Validation:**
```bash
npm run build  # Static export must succeed
```

**Performance Testing:**
```bash
# Run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools
# Targets: Performance ≥90, Accessibility ≥90, LCP <2.5s
```

**Manual Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Visual review at 320px, 768px, 1440px
- [ ] Keyboard navigation (Tab to CTA, Enter to activate)
- [ ] Screen reader test (NVDA or VoiceOver)
- [ ] CTA actions work (phone, form scroll, link)
- [ ] Dynamic branding applies correctly
- [ ] No console errors or warnings

### Completion Notes List

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Created HeroSection as Server Component with Client Component extraction pattern
2. Implemented CTAButton as separate Client Component for event handling
3. Added conditional rendering for hero image to handle empty imageUrl gracefully
4. Used CSS custom properties for dynamic branding (--brand-primary, --brand-secondary)
5. Implemented responsive grid layout (mobile-first: single column → two-column desktop)
6. Applied LCP optimization with Next.js Image priority prop
7. Ensured 44×44px minimum touch targets for CTA buttons
8. Added ARIA labels for accessibility

**Technical Decisions:**
- **Server/Client Split:** HeroSection is Server Component, CTAButton extracted as Client Component with 'use client' directive
- **Dynamic Branding:** CSS custom properties set via inline styles on section element
- **Image Handling:** Conditional rendering prevents React errors when imageUrl is empty
- **Responsive Strategy:** Tailwind grid with breakpoints (base/md:/xl:)
- **Action Types:** Switch statement handling phone/form/link actions in CTAButton

**Type Safety Fixes:**
- Fixed pageId type mismatch (string → number) in content-data.ts:32
- Fixed Map type inference in export-airtable-to-json.ts (explicit TestimonialRecord and StaffRecord types)
- Fixed default pageId value in export script (page.id → 0)

**Visual Testing with Realistic Data:**

After initial implementation, comprehensive visual testing was performed with realistic bathroom remodeling content to validate all features:

**Test Data Used:**
- H1 Headline: "Expert Bathroom Remodeling in Strongsville, OH"
- Subheadline: "Transform your bathroom into a luxurious retreat. Licensed contractors, 5-year warranty, and free design consultation included with every project."
- Hero Image: Unsplash bathroom photo (https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1552321554-5fefe8c9ef14)
- Primary CTA: "Get Free Quote" (form scroll action)
- Secondary CTA: "Call (440) 555-1234" (phone action)
- Branding: #0ea5e9 (sky blue) primary, #8b5cf6 (purple) secondary

**Responsive Testing Results:**

1. **Mobile (375px × 667px):** ✅ PASS

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-15

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Grade: A- (Excellent implementation with minor quality gate concerns)**

The HeroSection component demonstrates professional-grade implementation with strong adherence to Next.js 15 and React 19 best practices. The Server/Client component separation is properly executed, TypeScript strict mode compliance is verified, and the responsive design implementation is thorough and well-tested.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Clean component architecture with proper Server/Client split
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode passing (0 errors)
- ✅ Comprehensive visual testing across 3 breakpoints
- ✅ Excellent accessibility implementation (ARIA labels, keyboard nav, touch targets)
- ✅ Well-documented code with clear comments
- ✅ Dynamic branding using CSS custom properties (elegant solution)
- ✅ Conditional rendering for empty imageUrl (good defensive programming)
- ✅ Next.js Image optimization with priority prop

**Areas of Concern:**
- ⚠️ No automated tests (acknowledged as Phase 2, but creates technical debt)
- ⚠️ Performance metrics (LCP, CLS) not measured despite AC6 requirement
- ⚠️ ESLint not configured (detected during review)
- ℹ️ Form scroll target (#contact-form) doesn't exist yet (expected)

### Refactoring Performed

**No refactoring performed** - Code quality is already high and follows established patterns. All code is production-ready as-is.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✅ PASS
  - TypeScript strict mode enabled and passing
  - Server Components by default with proper 'use client' for CTAButton
  - Props interfaces explicitly defined
  - Proper destructuring and early returns
  - CSS classes organized by category

- **Project Structure**: ✅ PASS
  - Components in `src/components/HeroSection/`
  - Proper barrel export via index.ts
  - File naming follows PascalCase for components
  - Type imports from centralized `src/types/content-data.ts`

- **Testing Strategy**: ⚠️ CONCERNS
  - No automated tests (manual QA only)
  - Performance metrics stated but not measured with Lighthouse
  - Deferred to Phase 2 per story notes, but creates technical debt

- **All ACs Met**: ✅ PASS (with caveats)
  - AC1 (Dynamic branding): ✅ Fully met
  - AC2 (Responsive 3 breakpoints): ✅ Fully met and visually verified
  - AC3 (Accessibility standards): ✅ Fully met (44×44px, ARIA labels)
  - AC4 (Next.js Image support): ✅ Fully met (priority, responsive sizing)
  - AC5 (Content from JSON): ✅ Fully met
  - AC6 (LCP optimization): ⚠️ PARTIALLY MET - priority prop added but not measured

### Improvements Checklist

**Quality Gate Items:**
- [ ] Configure ESLint (recommend running: `npx @next/codemod@canary next-lint-to-eslint-cli .`)
- [ ] Measure actual LCP performance with Lighthouse (target: <500ms, requirement: <2.5s)
- [ ] Measure CLS with Lighthouse (target: 0.00, requirement: <0.1)
- [ ] Consider adding component tests in Phase 2 (React Testing Library)
- [ ] Consider adding E2E test for CTA interactions in Phase 2 (Playwright)

**Future Enhancements (Optional):**
- [ ] Add loading state for hero image (skeleton or blur placeholder)
- [ ] Consider lazy loading for below-the-fold images in future components
- [ ] Add error boundary for graceful fallback if image fails to load

### Security Review

**Status: PASS** - No security concerns identified

- ✅ No user input handling (display component only)
- ✅ No external API calls
- ✅ No sensitive data exposure
- ✅ XSS protection via React's built-in escaping
- ✅ Safe use of CSS custom properties (sanitized color hex codes)

**Note:** Phone CTA uses `tel:` protocol (standard and safe). Form CTA uses smooth scroll (no navigation security risks).

### Performance Considerations

**Status: CONCERNS** - Implementation looks good but metrics not validated

**What's Implemented:**
- ✅ Next.js Image component with `priority` prop for LCP optimization
- ✅ Responsive image sizing with `sizes` attribute
- ✅ AVIF/WebP/JPEG support via Next.js automatic optimization
- ✅ Conditional rendering to avoid empty image requests
- ✅ Minimal client-side JavaScript (only CTAButton is Client Component)

**What's Missing:**
- ⚠️ No Lighthouse performance audit conducted
- ⚠️ LCP target (<500ms) stated but not measured
- ⚠️ CLS target (0.00) stated but not measured
- ⚠️ No Core Web Vitals validation

**Recommendation:** Run Lighthouse audit in Chrome DevTools on deployed page to validate performance targets. This should be done before marking story as "Done".

### Files Modified During Review

**No files modified during review** - Code quality was already excellent.

### Requirements Traceability Matrix

| AC# | Requirement | Test Coverage | Status |
|-----|-------------|---------------|--------|
| AC1 | Dynamic branding (colors, logo, typography) | Manual visual test with #0ea5e9 and #8b5cf6 | ✅ PASS |
| AC2 | Responsive across 3 breakpoints (320px, 768px, 1440px) | Manual visual test at 375px, 768px, 1440px | ✅ PASS |
| AC3 | CTA button accessibility (44×44px, ARIA labels) | Manual keyboard nav test, DOM inspection | ✅ PASS |
| AC4 | Hero image supports AVIF/WebP/JPEG with Next.js Image | Code review + visual verification | ✅ PASS |
| AC5 | Service headline and subheadline render from content.json | Manual visual test with realistic data | ✅ PASS |
| AC6 | LCP optimization (preload hero image, above-fold critical CSS) | Code review (priority prop present) | ⚠️ PARTIAL |

**Coverage Gaps:**
- AC6 requires performance measurement, not just implementation
- No automated test coverage (deferred to Phase 2)

### Gate Status

**Gate: CONCERNS** → `docs/qa/gates/2.1-herosection-component.yml`

**Decision Rationale:**
While implementation quality is excellent and all functional requirements are met, three quality concerns prevent a PASS gate:
1. Performance metrics (LCP, CLS) not measured despite being explicit requirements in AC6
2. ESLint not configured (quality tooling gap)
3. No automated test coverage (technical debt acknowledged but creates risk)

**What would make this PASS:**
- Lighthouse audit showing LCP <2.5s (target <500ms) and CLS <0.1 (target 0.00)
- ESLint configured with Next.js recommended rules
- (Optional but recommended) Basic component tests for CTAButton click handlers

**Quality Score:** 70/100
- Base: 100
- -10 for missing performance measurements (AC6 gap)
- -10 for ESLint not configured
- -10 for no automated tests (acknowledged technical debt)

### Recommended Status

**⚠️ Changes Recommended** - See unchecked items in Improvements Checklist

**Next Steps for Dev Team:**
1. Run Lighthouse audit on deployed page to measure LCP and CLS
2. Configure ESLint using Next.js codemod
3. If performance metrics pass, update story with results and mark as "Ready for Done"

**For Product Owner:**
The component is functionally complete and production-ready. The CONCERNS gate is about measurement gaps, not implementation quality. If the team accepts technical debt of no tests + unmeasured performance, this can be marked Done with a waiver.
