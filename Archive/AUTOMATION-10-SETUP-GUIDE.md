# Automation-10 Setup Guide: Create Pages When Location Added

## Overview

**What it does:** Automatically creates Pages records when a new Location is added to the Locations table.

**Example:**
- Add "San Antonio, TX" to Locations table
- If you have 3 Services with 5 keywords each = 15 keywords total
- Creates 15 new Pages (1 per Service √ó Keyword for San Antonio)

**Time Required:** ~10 minutes

**‚ö° Performance:** Uses batch creation for 10-50x faster page generation
- Can handle 750+ pages in 30 seconds (vs old limit of ~100)
- Timeout is extremely unlikely with current implementation

---

   üìÑ Checking against 50 existing pages...

   üì¶ Service: "Bathroom Remodeling" (6 valid keywords)
      ‚úÖ CREATED: "bathroom remodel"
      ‚úÖ CREATED: "bathroom renovation"
      ... etc ...

   ==================================================
   AUTOMATION COMPLETE
   ==================================================
   ```

6. **Check the output values** at the bottom:
   - `result: "success"`
   - `created: 15` (or whatever number)
   - `skipped: 0` (since test should find no duplicates)
   - `errors: 0`

### Step 9: Verify Pages Were Created

1. Open your **Pages** table

2. Add a filter:
   - Field: **Location ID**
   - Condition: **is**
   - Value: Select the test location you used

3. You should see newly created pages:
   - Each has Target Keyword filled
   - Each has Status = "Draft"
   - Each has Published = false
   - Service ID and Location ID are linked

4. ‚úÖ **If pages look good, continue to Step 10**

### Step 10: Activate the Automation

1. Go back to the Automations view

2. Find your automation "Create Pages When Location Added"

3. Click the **toggle switch** (top-right) to turn it **ON**

4. Toggle should turn **green**

   - Click to see the log output
   - Verify it created pages successfully

7. Go to **Pages** table:
   - Filter by Location = San Antonio
   - Should see all new pages

8. ‚úÖ **Success! Automation is working!**

## Troubleshooting

### Automation Didn't Fire

**Check:**
- Is automation toggle ON (green)?
- Did you actually save the location record?
- Check Automations ‚Üí History tab for errors

**Solution:**
- Try editing the location again (add/remove space in City name)
- Or manually click "Test" button to re-run

### "recordId is not defined" Error

**Problem:** Input variable not configured correctly

**Solution:**
1. Edit automation
2. Click on script action
3. Verify input variable:
   - Name: `recordId` (exact spelling, lowercase)
   - Value: "Record ID" from trigger

### Script Timeout (30 seconds)

**Problem:** Too many pages to create at once (750+)

**Solution:**
- **NEW:** Script now uses batch creation (createRecordsAsync)
- Can handle 750+ pages before timeout (vs old limit of ~100)
- Timeout is now extremely unlikely

**If timeout still occurs (750+ pages):**
1. Check Automations ‚Üí History for timeout error
2. Note how many pages were created before timeout
3. Click **"Test"** button to re-run automation
4. Select the same Location that timed out
5. Duplicate detection will skip pages already created
6. Continue until you see: `Created: 0` (all done!)

**Why this is safe:**
- Your duplicate detection prevents duplicate pages
- Each re-run picks up where it left off
- Can re-run as many times as needed

### Pages Created But Missing Data

**Check:**
1. Do Services have "Client" field populated?
2. Do Services have "Primary Keywords" filled?
3. Check automation log for specific errors

**Solution:**
- Update Service records to fill required fields
- Re-run automation with "Test" button

### Duplicate Pages Created

**Problem:** Script's duplicate detection failed

**Check:**
- Does "Target Keyword" field exist in Pages table?
- Are existing pages populated with Target Keywords?

**Solution:**
- Clean up duplicates manually
- Verify Target Keyword field exists and is populated

---

## Expected Results

### Small Setup (10 keywords total)
- Add 1 Location ‚Üí Creates 10 pages
- Execution time: < 1 second

### Medium Setup (50 keywords total)
- Add 1 Location ‚Üí Creates 50 pages
- Execution time: 1-2 seconds

### Large Setup (100-750 keywords)
- Add 1 Location ‚Üí Creates 100-750 pages
- Execution time: 5-25 seconds
- ‚úÖ **No timeout** - Uses batch creation (50 records per batch)

### Very Large Setup (750+ keywords)
- Add 1 Location ‚Üí May approach 30 second timeout
- If timeout occurs, simply re-run using "Test" button
- Duplicate detection prevents duplicate pages
