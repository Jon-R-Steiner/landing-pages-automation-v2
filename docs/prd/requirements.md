3. **Service Description** - Brief explanation of services (Quality Score relevance - "what do you do?")
4. **Before/After Gallery** - 6-8 visual proof examples with location-specific captions (builds trust through results)
5. **Why Choose Us / Benefits** - 3-5 key differentiators (licensed, fixed-price quotes, years in business, guarantees)
6. **Social Proof / Testimonials** - 5 customer testimonials with ratings, locations, photos/avatars
7. **Process Overview** - 4-5 step timeline (consultation → design → installation → completion) to reduce anxiety
8. **FAQ Section** - 5-8 common questions/objections addressed (accordion format)
