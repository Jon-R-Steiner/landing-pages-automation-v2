# Goals and Background Context

### Goals

#### System Capability Goals (MVP)
- **Content Quality:** Generate conversion-optimized, TCPA-compliant landing pages with message match to ad copy, achieving 90%+ human approval rate without manual editing
- **System Reliability:** Achieve 95%+ successful builds with zero runtime deployment failures through deterministic build-time generation
- **Throughput Validation:** Successfully process multi-tier validation batches (10-20, 50-100, 250-500 pages) demonstrating production-scale capability
- **Automation Efficiency:** Enable 100-page batch generation in <15 minutes (content generation) + <5 minutes (build/deploy)

#### End-User Success Goals (Pilot Client)
- **Conversion Performance:** Achieve 5-10% conversion rate (paid visitors → leads) within 30 days of deployment
- **Quality Score:** Maintain Google Ads Quality Score of 7-10 across landing pages, reducing cost-per-click (CPC)
- **Cost Per Lead:** Reduce CPL to <$50 through optimized landing page conversion performance
- **Page Performance:** Pass Core Web Vitals (LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1) - CRITICAL for Quality Score and ad costs
- **Message Match:** Achieve <50% bounce rate indicating strong ad-to-page headline alignment

#### Business Enablement Goals (Post-MVP)
- **Agency Capacity Scaling:** Reduce project delivery time from 10-15 hours to 2-3 hours (setup + oversight), enabling service to 20-30 clients annually vs. current 8-10 manual capacity
- **Market Differentiation:** Establish "AI-powered paid traffic optimization" as competitive offering with proof-of-concept case study from pilot client
- **Recurring Revenue Model:** Convert 50%+ of project clients to monthly retainer for ongoing page generation and optimization within 6 months of service launch

### Background Context

**The Problem:**

Home services contractors (bathroom remodeling, HVAC, roofing, plumbing) compete on paid search (Google Ads Performance Max), requiring 100-200+ location-specific and service-specific landing pages optimized for converting paid traffic from "[service] in [city]" ad campaigns. These pages must achieve high Quality Scores (7-10) to reduce cost-per-click and maximize ROI, while maintaining 5-10% conversion rates to generate leads profitably. Traditional manual copywriting ($100-200/page × 200 pages = $30,000) prices comprehensive coverage out of reach for mid-market contractors. DIY page builders produce generic content that doesn't convert. Existing AI content tools require heavy manual editing and lack deployment automation. The market needs high-quality AI content generation combined with end-to-end workflow orchestration at affordable economics.

**Who This Serves:**

*Primary Users:* Solo web developers and small agencies (1-3 person teams) currently serving local service businesses who are constrained by manual content creation bottlenecks. They can handle 8-10 client projects annually but want to scale to 20-30 without hiring.

*End Clients:* Mid-market home services contractors ($500k-$5M revenue) who invest $1-5k/month in digital marketing, understand SEO value, and need comprehensive local coverage but cannot afford traditional agency pricing.

**Why Now:**

AI content generation capabilities (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4) crossed the quality threshold in 2024-2025 where generated content competes with human-written copy for SEO ranking and conversion. Long-context windows enable brand voice consistency across hundreds of pages. Combined with modern static site generation (Next.js) and workflow orchestration platforms (Make.com, Airtable), end-to-end automation is now technically and economically viable.

**Our Approach:**

This system automates landing page generation at scale through a multi-stage pipeline: content orchestration → AI generation → static site building → CDN deployment. By validating capability through multi-tier testing (10-20 pages → 50-100 pages → 250-500 pages), we de-risk scaling assumptions before committing to pilot client delivery. The MVP focuses exclusively on proving the core capability works reliably at production scale before building ancillary features.

### Change Log

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| 2025-01-07 | 1.0 | Initial PRD creation from approved Project Brief | John (PM) |
| 2025-01-08 | 2.0 | Added Epic List, Epic Details (0-6), Development Workflow Standards, and ARCHITECT handoff plan. Incorporated lessons from previous deployment post-mortem. Finalized all sections for ARCHITECT handoff. | John (PM) |
| 2025-01-08 | 2.1 | **MAJOR UPDATE:** Aligned PRD with paid traffic requirements per front-end-spec.md. Changed from SEO/organic focus to Google Ads Performance Max paid traffic optimization. Updated Goals (conversion rate, Quality Score, CPL vs rankings/traffic), added 15 new requirements (FR14-FR27, NFR10-NFR12) for message match, conversion tracking, 3-stage forms, GTM/CallRail integration. Updated UI section structure (10-section vertical scroll), data flow (ad copy inputs), form handling (3-stage progressive), and tech stack (tracking technologies). See SCP-001 for complete analysis. Timeline updated: 18-28 days (was 14-22 days). | John (PM) |
| 2025-10-15 | 3.0 | **EPIC REORGANIZATION:** Declared Phase 0 COMPLETE at Phase 0.4. Reorganized Epic structure to align with BMad methodology: Epic 2 (Component Development - NEW), Epic 3 (Scale Testing - NEW), Epic 4 (Form Submission - RENAMED from Epic 2), Epic 5-8 (RENUMBERED). Reason: Phase 0 had grown beyond foundation work to include feature development. New structure enables proper story creation and tracking. No functional changes, organizational clarity only. | Sarah (PO) |
