# Workflows Folder Reorganization Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Purpose:** Separate build-time setup docs from ongoing operational workflows

---

## Why This Change?

### Problem Identified

The previous structure mixed:
- **One-time setup documentation** (used only during build phase)
- **Ongoing operational workflows** (used continuously after production)

This made it unclear:
- Which docs to archive after production launch
- Which docs remain active for day-to-day operations
- Where workflows lived (split between `architecture/` and `workflows/`)

### Solution

Reorganized into **lifecycle-based structure**:
- `workflows/build/` - One-time setup (archive after launch)
- `workflows/ongoing/` - Operational workflows (active forever)

---

## What Changed

### Old Structure (Problematic)

```
docs/
├── architecture/
│   ├── 1-content-creation-workflow.md      ← Workflow in wrong place
│   ├── 2-build-deployment-workflow.md      ← Workflow in wrong place
│   ├── 3-form-submission-workflow.md       ← Workflow in wrong place
│   └── deployment-workflow.md              ← Workflow in wrong place
└── workflows/
    └── airtable-to-production/             ← Misleading name
        ├── (operational workflow docs)     ← Should stay active
        ├── (automation setup guides)       ← Should be archived
        └── (mixed content)
```

### New Structure (Clear)

```
docs/workflows/
├── build/                                   # ONE-TIME SETUP
│   ├── README.md                            # "Archive after production"
│   └── airtable-setup/

│       ├── automation-1-edge-cases.md
│       ├── automation-1-test-plan.md
│       ├── AUTOMATION-1-SUMMARY.md

        └── next-steps.md
```

## File Moves Summary

### From `architecture/` → `workflows/ongoing/`

- ✅ `1-content-creation-workflow.md` → `content-creation-workflow.md`
- ✅ `2-build-deployment-workflow.md` → `build-deployment-workflow.md`
- ✅ `3-form-submission-workflow.md` → `form-submission-workflow.md`
- ✅ `deployment-workflow.md` → `deployment-workflow.md`

**Reason:** Workflows belong in `workflows/`, not `architecture/`

### From `workflows/airtable-to-production/` → `workflows/build/airtable-setup/`

- ✅ `airtable-automation-setup-guide.md`
- ✅ `automation-1-edge-cases.md`
- ✅ `automation-1-test-plan.md`
- ✅ `AUTOMATION-1-SUMMARY.md`
- ✅ `QUICK-START.md`
- ✅ `PHASE-0.3a-STATUS.md`

**Reason:** One-time setup docs should be archived after production

### From `workflows/airtable-to-production/` → `workflows/ongoing/approval-to-live/`

- ✅ `index.md`
- ✅ `1-marketing-review-approval.md`
- ✅ `2-airtable-automation-trigger.md`
- ✅ `3-github-actions-export.md`
- ✅ `4-netlify-build-deploy.md`
- ✅ `overview-the-complete-flow.md`
- ✅ `complete-timeline-draft-live.md`
- ✅ `cost-analysis.md`
- ✅ `error-handling-monitoring.md`
- ✅ `next-steps.md`

**Reason:** Operational workflows stay active after production

### Folder Removed

- ❌ `workflows/airtable-to-production/` - Deleted (empty)

---

## Documentation Updates

### `docs/README.md` - Updated References

**Old:**
```markdown
### `workflows/` - Operational Processes

**Airtable to Production Workflow:**
- [workflows/airtable-to-production/](workflows/airtable-to-production/)
```

**New:**
```markdown
### `workflows/` - Operational Processes & Build Documentation

**Organized by lifecycle phase:**

**`workflows/build/` - One-Time Setup Documentation:**
- ⚠️ **Archive after production launch**

**`workflows/ongoing/` - Operational Workflows:**
- ✅ **Active after production launch**
```

### New README Files Created

1. **`workflows/build/README.md`**
   - Explains build-time setup docs
   - Instructs to archive after production
   - Lists what's included

2. **`workflows/ongoing/README.md`**
   - Explains operational workflows
   - Active reference for teams
   - Lists all ongoing workflows

### Updated Index Files

- **`workflows/ongoing/approval-to-live/index.md`**
  - Updated cross-references to new paths
  - Renamed from "Airtable → Production" to "Approval to Live"
  - Added links to related workflows

---

## Benefits of New Structure

### 1. Clear Lifecycle Separation ✅

**Build Phase (Phase 0):**
- Use `workflows/build/` for setup
- Follow automation guides
- Configure integrations

**Production (Phase 1+):**
- Archive `workflows/build/` → `Archive/build-phase-docs/`
- Use `workflows/ongoing/` for operations
- Continuously update operational workflows

### 2. Correct Organization ✅

- Workflows no longer in `architecture/` (wrong place)
- All workflows in `workflows/` (correct place)
- Clear naming: `approval-to-live` vs `airtable-to-production`

### 3. Team Clarity ✅

**Marketing Team:**
- Use `workflows/ongoing/content-creation-workflow.md`
- Use `workflows/ongoing/approval-to-live/` for publishing

**Development Team:**
- Use `workflows/ongoing/build-deployment-workflow.md`
- Use `workflows/build/` only during setup (then archive)

**Support Team:**
- Reference `workflows/ongoing/` for troubleshooting
- Ignore `workflows/build/` after production

### 4. Future-Proof ✅

Easy to add new build-time or operational docs:
- New automation setup → `workflows/build/`
- New operational process → `workflows/ongoing/`

---

## Migration Path for Future Phases

### Phase 0 (Current - Build Phase)

```
workflows/
├── build/           ← ACTIVE (setup guides)
└── ongoing/         ← REFERENCE (planning)
```

### Phase 1 (Production Launch)

```
workflows/
├── build/           ← ARCHIVE to Archive/build-phase-docs/
└── ongoing/         ← ACTIVE (daily operations)
```

### Post-Production (Phase 2+)

```
workflows/
└── ongoing/         ← CONTINUOUSLY UPDATED
    ├── (existing workflows)
    └── (new features added here)

Archive/
└── build-phase-docs/  ← Historical reference
```

---

## Cross-Reference Updates Completed

✅ Updated `docs/README.md`:
- Workflows section updated
- Decision tree paths updated
- Quick links updated

✅ Updated `workflows/ongoing/approval-to-live/index.md`:
- Cross-references to new paths
- Related documentation links
- Setup docs reference

✅ Created README files:
- `workflows/build/README.md`
- `workflows/ongoing/README.md`

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Complete ✅)

- [x] Create new folder structure
- [x] Move build-time docs
- [x] Move operational workflows
- [x] Update cross-references
- [x] Create README files
- [x] Update main docs/README.md

### When Production Launches (Phase 1)

1. **Archive Build Docs:**
   ```bash
   mv docs/workflows/build/ Archive/build-phase-docs/
   ```

2. **Update References:**
   - Remove `workflows/build/` from docs/README.md
   - Update to show only `workflows/ongoing/`

3. **Team Training:**
   - Marketing team: Focus on `workflows/ongoing/`
   - Dev team: Use `workflows/ongoing/` for deployment

### Ongoing (Phase 2+)

- Add new operational workflows to `workflows/ongoing/`
- Keep `workflows/ongoing/` updated as processes evolve
- Never add to `workflows/build/` (archived after Phase 1)

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Clear separation of build vs operational docs
✅ Workflows in correct location (`workflows/`, not `architecture/`)
✅ Easy to archive build docs after production
✅ Clear team guidance on which docs to use
✅ Future-proof structure for new workflows

---

**Reorganization Status:** ✅ Complete
**Date Completed:** 2025-10-11
**Impact:** All teams now have clear workflow documentation organized by lifecycle phase
