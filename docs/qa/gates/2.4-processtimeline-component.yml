  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No vulnerabilities. Read-only component with proper data validation. No user input handling."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent. Zero JavaScript, Server Component, ~1KB CSS, static rendering. No Core Web Vitals impact."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Robust. Graceful null handling, data validation filters malformed steps, TypeScript strict mode prevents runtime errors."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent. Clear structure, inline documentation, follows coding standards, TypeScript interfaces for type safety."
