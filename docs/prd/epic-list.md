### Epic 8: AI Content Generation System (DEFERRED from old Epic 3)
**Owner:** Development team
**Dependencies:** Epic 0 complete, Epic 1 complete (Airtable schema)
**Duration Estimate:** 4-6 days (when implemented in Phase 2)
**Status:** üîÑ DEFERRED TO PHASE 2

Design and implement AI-powered content generation system using Claude API to create SEO-optimized, TCPA-compliant landing page content at scale. This epic has been deferred to Phase 2 to prioritize static site generation, component development, and form submission capability in Phase 1.

**Key Deliverables (Phase 2):**
- Master prompt template for Claude API (variable placeholders for client, service, location, brand voice)
- Output schema definition (JSON contract for Airtable storage and Next.js consumption)
- Make.com content generation scenario (fetch pending pages ‚Üí call Claude API ‚Üí store results ‚Üí update status)
- Quality validation checks (word count, TCPA compliance, metadata completeness, keyword density)
- Batch processing with rate limit handling (50 req/min for Claude API)
- Error handling and retry logic
- Multi-tier validation (10 pages ‚Üí 50 pages ‚Üí 100 pages)

**Rationale for Deferral:** Business priorities shifted to deliver working static site with forms first (Epics 0-4) before adding AI content generation. This allows earlier validation of conversion capability and simpler initial implementation.
