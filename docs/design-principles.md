## 1. Context: Paid Traffic Landing Pages

### What These Pages Are

These are **high-conversion landing pages for Google Ads Performance Max campaigns**, NOT organic SEO pages:

- **Traffic Source**: 100% paid (Google Ads) - NOT organic search
- **Single Goal**: Convert paid visitors to leads (phone calls or form submissions)
- **Template Approach**: Standard evergreen page structure with dynamic content
- **Target Audience**: Homeowners aged 45-75 searching for bathroom remodeling contractors
- **Success Metric**: Conversion rate, Cost Per Lead (CPL), Quality Score

### How This Changes Design Priorities

| Organic SEO Pages | Paid Traffic Pages (This Project) |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1500-2500 words (keyword optimization) | 800-1200 words (concise, conversion-focused) |
| Rank in search results | Convert paid visitors to leads |
| Keywords, backlinks, technical SEO | Message match, CRO, Quality Score |
| Internal linking, site hierarchy | Minimal navigation (avoid distraction) |
| Important load speed | CRITICAL load speed (wasting ad spend) |

## 2. Core Design Principles

### 1. Quality Score First

Every design decision optimized for **Google Ads Quality Score** (target: 7-10):
- **Message match** between ad copy and landing page headline
- **Mobile UX** optimized for 60%+ mobile traffic
- **Page speed** under 2.5s LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
- **Trust signals** visible above fold (licensing, reviews, years)
- **Useful content** without SEO bloat

### 2. Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) Above All

Single-minded focus on **lead generation** (target: 5-10% conversion rate):
- **Strategic trust signal placement** (hero, trust bar, testimonials)
- **Psychology-driven CTA positioning** (primary phone, secondary form)
- **Friction-free forms** (minimal fields, clear value proposition)
- **Persuasive copy** (benefit-driven, specific, quantified proof)

### 3. Message Match Integrity

Landing page must **align precisely with ad copy**:
- Headline matches ad promise (critical for Quality Score and bounce rate)
- Imagery supports ad message (walk-in showers if ad mentions accessibility)
- Offer consistency (free estimate → page shows "Get Free Estimate")
- Location specificity ("Cleveland" in ad → "Cleveland" in headline)

### 4. Phone-Primary Conversion Path

**Large, prominent, clickable phone numbers** as primary CTA:
- Aligns with 45-75 demographic preferences (phone > form)
- Tap-to-call on mobile (60%+ of traffic)
- Contact form as secondary option
- Phone number visible in hero, trust bar, and footer

### 5. Trust Through Specificity

**Quantified proof points** build contractor credibility:
- ✅ License numbers: "Licensed OH #123456"
- ✅ Years in business: "Since 2008"
- ✅ Project count: "500+ bathrooms remodeled"
- ✅ Review ratings: "⭐ 4.9/5 from 127 homeowners"
- ❌ Avoid vague claims: "Best contractor" or "Quality work"

### 6. Paid Traffic Accountability

**Comprehensive conversion tracking** enables optimization:
- Call tracking integration (phone number conversion)
- Form submission tracking (GTM event tracking)
- Engagement metrics (scroll depth, time on page, CTA clicks)
- ROI measurement (Cost Per Lead, conversion rate by ad group)

---

## 3. Success Metrics (KPIs)

### Primary Metrics
- **Conversion Rate**: 5-10% target (leads ÷ visitors)
- **Cost Per Lead (CPL)**: <$50 target (ad spend ÷ conversions)
- **Quality Score**: 7-10 target (Google Ads rating)

### Secondary Metrics
- **Bounce Rate**: <50% (indicates message match quality)
- **Time on Page**: >2 minutes (indicates engagement)
- **Form Completion Rate**: >50% (indicates form UX quality)
- **Phone:Form Ratio**: Track to understand preferred conversion method

### Performance Metrics (Core Web Vitals)
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: <2.5 seconds
- **FID (First Input Delay)**: <100ms
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: <0.1

---

## 4. Usability Goals

- **Instant Message Match Recognition**: User confirms ad promise within 3 seconds
- **Zero-Friction Lead Capture**: Phone number and form accessible immediately
- **Trust Establishment in 5 Seconds**: Licensing, reviews, years visible above fold
- **Senior-Friendly Accessibility**: Large text (18px+ body), high contrast (4.5:1+)
- **Fast Load Speed**: LCP <2.5s (affects UX and Quality Score)
- **Mobile-Optimized Conversion**: All conversion paths thumb-friendly

---

## 5. 10-Section Page Structure

Every landing page follows this **standardized vertical flow** (single-page, no navigation):

1. **Hero Section** - Message match delivery, primary conversion capture
   - H1 headline, subheadline, hero image
   - Primary CTA (phone), secondary CTA (form)
   - Trust signals (rating, license, years)

2. **Trust Bar** - Persistent credibility signals (optional sticky)
   - License number, years in business, review count, phone

3. **Service Description** - Quality Score relevance, keyword integration
   - H2, 200-300 words describing services
   - Key services list (bulleted or icon grid)

4. **Before/After Gallery** - Visual proof builds trust
   - 6-8 image pairs, lazy-loaded, WebP format
   - Location captions (e.g., "Lincoln Park Master Bath, 2023")

5. **Why Choose Us** - Differentiation, value proposition
   - 3-5 key differentiators with supporting copy
   - Icons, quantified proof points

6. **Social Proof / Testimonials** - Peer validation
   - 5 testimonials with photos, names, locations, ratings
   - Aggregate stats, third-party badges (Google, BBB, Angi)

7. **Process Overview** - Reduce anxiety, set expectations
   - 4-5 step timeline (consultation → quote → installation → walkthrough)
   - Timeline expectations ("Most projects: 2-3 weeks")

8. **FAQ Section** - Address objections, Quality Score content
   - 6-8 common questions (pricing, timeline, permits, warranties)
   - Expand/collapse interaction

9. **Final CTA Section** - Last conversion opportunity
   - H2, benefit reinforcement, dual CTA (phone + form)
   - Optional urgency ("Book This Month for Spring Installation")

10. **Footer** - Legal compliance, minimal distraction
    - Privacy Policy link (required), TCPA disclaimer
    - Address, phone, service area list, copyright

**Section Order Rationale**: Strategic flow from message match → trust building → social proof → objection handling → final conversion push.

## 6. Mobile-First Design Requirements

**60%+ of paid traffic is mobile** - mobile UX is PRIMARY, not secondary:

### Mobile Optimization Checklist
- ✅ Tap targets minimum 48x48px (thumb-friendly)
- ✅ Click-to-call phone numbers (tel: links)
- ✅ Form fields large enough for mobile keyboards
- ✅ Minimal pinch/zoom required (readable at default zoom)
- ✅ Images optimized for mobile bandwidth (WebP, lazy loading)
- ✅ Sticky phone button on mobile (persistent conversion path)
- ✅ Test on iOS Safari and Android Chrome (primary browsers)

**Mobile Layout Principles**:
- Single column vertical stack (no complex multi-column layouts)
- Hero image below headline on mobile (text-first for message match)
- Contact form below fold on mobile (avoid above-fold clutter)
- Trust bar condenses to phone button only (avoid header clutter)

**Full mobile optimization guide**: See [docs/components/mobile-optimization-checklist.md](./components/mobile-optimization-checklist.md)

## 7. Metadata Requirements for Google Ads

### Title Tag Template
**Pattern**: `{{service_type}} {{location_modifier}} | {{contractor_name}}`

**Example**: "Bathroom Remodeling Near Cleveland | ABC Remodeling"

**Rules**:
- Target 55 characters for universal display (mobile truncates at 50-60)
- Include primary keyword from ad (message match)
- Include location if in keyword
- Use separator " | " for clarity
- ❌ Don't keyword stuff or use ALL CAPS

### Meta Description Template
**Pattern**: `{{value_proposition}} in {{location}}. {{trust_signals}}. {{cta}}.`

**Example**: "Professional bathroom remodeling in Cleveland. Licensed & insured with 15+ years experience. Get your free estimate today."

**Rules**:
- Target 155 characters for optimal display (mobile truncates at 120-130)
- Include 1-2 trust signals (licensed, years, customer count)
- Include clear CTA
- Write for humans, not just search engines
- ❌ Don't exceed 160 characters or use quotes

## 10. Typical Development Workflow

When implementing UI components for paid landing pages:

1. **Read this document** (design-principles.md) - Get core context (~5 min)
2. **Load component guide** (e.g., trust-bar-implementation.md) - Get technical HOW (~10 min)
3. **Implement component** - Follow guide patterns and code examples
4. **Reference full spec as needed** - If component guide lacks detail, check front-end-spec.md sections
5. **Validate against principles** - Check message match, CRO, Quality Score, mobile UX

**Example**: Implementing Trust Bar component
- Load: `design-principles.md` → `trust-bar-implementation.md`
- Implement: Follow React component pattern, styling, accessibility
- Validate: Trust signals visible? Mobile-optimized? Meets CRO principles?
- Reference: If unclear on content requirements, check front-end-spec.md Section 2
