Auto-generates Pages when Offer targeting is UPDATED.

BEHAVIOR:
• Triggers when Target Services, Target Locations, or Target Branches fields change
• Reads all Services and filters by updated Target Services
• Reads all Locations and filters by updated Target Locations
• Further filters by updated Target Branches (via Service Areas)
• Creates any MISSING pages based on new targeting
• Duplicate detection skips existing pages (additive behavior)
• Sets all new pages to Status: Draft, Published: false

WHY NEEDED:
When you update an offer's targeting (e.g., expand from Bathroom to include Kitchen),
this automation creates the new Kitchen pages without recreating existing Bathroom pages.

TARGETING:
• Target Services empty = ALL services
• Target Locations empty = ALL locations
• Target Branches empty = no additional filtering
• Target Branches set = only locations served by those branches

EXAMPLE:
Original: "Spring Sale" targets [Bathroom]
Update: Change to target [Bathroom, Kitchen]
→ Automation creates Kitchen pages
→ Skips existing Bathroom pages (duplicates)

NOTES:
• Watch specific fields to prevent triggering on unrelated changes
• Can create 100+ pages depending on targeting expansion
• Uses batch creation for performance
• Duplicate detection prevents re-creating pages
