  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Server Component (zero client JS), inline SVGs (no external requests), CLS prevention implemented (min-h reserved), 6KB bundle increase acceptable. Validated live on Netlify."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Graceful null handling (returns null if no signals), type-safe props, no external dependencies, deterministic rendering."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clear structure, good separation of concerns (icons/parsing/main), JSDoc comments, standards-compliant. Minor suggestions for icon extraction."
