# Testing Philosophy

**MVP Testing Approach:**
- ✅ Automated quality checks (Lighthouse, type checking, linting)
- ✅ Manual spot-checks (content quality, visual review)
- ⚠️ Unit/integration tests deferred to Phase 2 (not in MVP scope)

**Rationale:**
- Focus is on content quality and system capability validation
- Traditional test suites deferred until patterns stabilize
- Manual testing appropriate for MVP iteration speed
