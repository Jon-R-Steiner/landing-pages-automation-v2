# Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (ARCHITECT - Pre-Epic 0)

**Timeline:** 0.5-1 day

**Project Infrastructure Setup:**

**Task 1: Create Fresh GitHub Repository**
- Create NEW repository (clean start, no legacy BMAD folders from current repo)
- Repository name: To be proposed by Architect (e.g., `landing-pages-automation` or `local-seo-page-generator`)
- Set to Private initially
- Initialize with README or basic scaffold
- Add collaborators:
  - Jon Steiner (Admin access)
  - Developer (Write access when assigned)
- Document repo URL in handoff document

**Task 2: Create Netlify Site**
- Use Jon's Netlify account (credentials provided separately)
- Create new Netlify site for this project
- Connect GitHub repository to Netlify site
- Configure initial build settings (placeholders, will be refined in Epic 0.2):
  - Build command: `npm run build` (placeholder)
  - Publish directory: `out` (Next.js static export default)
  - Base directory: TBD by Architect (depends on monorepo decision)
- Document critical information:
  - Netlify Project ID: `[To be filled by Architect]`
  - Netlify site URL: `[To be filled by Architect]`
  - Build hook URL: `[To be filled by Architect - store securely]`
- Add Jon as site collaborator/admin if needed

**Task 3: Verify GitHub ‚Üî Netlify Connection**
- Push initial test commit to GitHub (e.g., README or basic HTML file)
- Trigger test deployment to Netlify (auto-deploy on push or manual trigger)
- Verify build succeeds (even if just static HTML)
- Verify deployed site is accessible via Netlify URL
- Test for any errors (build failures, 500 errors, path issues)
- **GATE:** Connection verified and deployment successful ‚Üí Proceed to Epic 0.1 Research

**Task 4: Developer Handoff Documentation**
Create handoff document with:
- GitHub repository URL
- GitHub access instructions (how to clone, branch strategy)
- Netlify Project ID
- Netlify site URL
- Netlify build hook URL (secure storage)
- Environment variables list (if any at this stage)
- Access credentials documentation (where stored, how to access)

**Deliverables:**
- ‚úÖ Fresh GitHub repository created and accessible
- ‚úÖ Netlify site created and connected to GitHub
- ‚úÖ Test deployment successful
- ‚úÖ All credentials and IDs documented
- ‚úÖ Developer onboarding doc ready

**Prerequisites for Jon to Provide:**
- Netlify account credentials OR add Architect as team member
- Confirmation of desired repository name (or let Architect propose)
- Any organizational/naming preferences

### Post-Epic 6: Pilot Client Delivery

**Prerequisites:**
- ‚úÖ Epic 6 complete with all validation tiers passed
- ‚úÖ Go decision from Tier 3 validation
- ‚úÖ System proven at 500-page scale

**Pilot Client Onboarding:**
1. Client selection and agreement

- Organic Traffic Growth: 50%+ increase within 90 days
- Ranking Success: Top-10 for 70%+ keywords within 6 months
- Lead Generation: 20%+ cost-per-lead reduction

---

### Phase 2 Roadmap (Post-MVP)

**Major Features (Deferred from Phase 1):**

**AI Content Generation System (Epic 3 - DEFERRED):**
- Master prompt template for Claude API with variable placeholders (client, service, location, brand voice)
- Make.com content generation scenario (fetch pending pages ‚Üí call Claude API ‚Üí store results ‚Üí update status)
- Output schema definition (JSON contract for Airtable storage and Next.js consumption)
- Quality validation checks (word count, TCPA compliance, metadata completeness, keyword density)
- Batch processing with rate limit handling (50 requests/minute for Claude API)
- Error handling and retry logic
- Multi-tier validation (10 pages ‚Üí 50 pages ‚Üí 100 pages)
- Message match validation (ad headline alignment scoring)

**Automation & Integration Enhancements:**
- Automated build triggers (Airtable webhook ‚Üí Netlify on status change to "Approved")
- Automated status synchronization (Netlify ‚Üí Airtable on deploy success)
- CI/CD pipeline integration (GitHub Actions for testing and deployment)
- Automated testing in deployment pipeline (Lighthouse CI, HTML validation, accessibility checks)
- Additional CRM integrations (HubSpot, other platforms for multi-client support)
- Traditional test suites (unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests)

**Platform & Operational Features:**
- Multi-client management features (client-specific dashboards, permission management)
- Analytics and reporting dashboard (conversion tracking, page performance, lead attribution)
- Content version control and approval workflow enhancements
- A/B testing capability (Page Variants table from airtable-data-model-v2-FUTURE.md)

**Rationale:** Phase 1 prioritizes delivery of working static site with forms and Salesforce integration to validate conversion capability before adding AI content generation complexity.

### ARCHITECT Handoff Package

When handing off to Architect, provide:

**Documents:**
- This PRD (complete requirements and epic specifications)
- Project Brief (background and business context)
- Post-Mortem from previous deployment attempt (lessons learned)

**Access:**
- Netlify account credentials or team membership
- GitHub organization access (if applicable)

**Context:**
- Previous Next.js + Netlify deployment failures (post-mortem details)
- Rationale for build-time static generation (no serverless functions)
- Big Bang research strategy preference (all 60 items upfront)

**Expected Deliverables from Architect:**
- Fresh GitHub repository (clean, no BMAD folders)
- Netlify site connected and test deployment successful
- Comprehensive ADRs for all 60 research items
- Reference implementation URLs and analysis
- Configuration file templates
- Developer handoff document

**Timeline:**
- Infrastructure setup: 0.5-1 day
- Big Bang research: 5-8 days
- Total Architect phase: ~6-9 days before development starts

---

### Communication & Coordination

**Architect ‚Üî PM:**
- Daily check-ins during research phase (optional)
- ADR review session when research complete
- Approval required before development handoff

**Architect ‚Üî Developer:**
- Comprehensive handoff document (all ADRs, config templates, runbooks)
- Office hours during Epic 0-4 for clarification questions
- Escalation path for architectural issues discovered during development

**PM ‚Üî Developer:**
- Epic completion reviews (validate success criteria met)
- Gate approvals at key decision points
- Pilot client coordination when ready

---

### Risk Management

**High-Risk Items:**
- Next.js 15 + Netlify compatibility (mitigated by Epic 0 research + reference implementations)
- Monorepo vs flat structure decision (mitigated by testing both, contingency for flattening)
- API rate limits at scale (mitigated by Epic 6 multi-tier validation)
- Content quality at scale (mitigated by Epic 1 validation + Epic 6 approval rate tracking)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Research-First development workflow (prevent assumption-based failures)
- Incremental deployment checkpoints (catch issues early)
- Validation gates at epic boundaries (no proceeding until success criteria met)
- Rollback procedures documented (quick recovery from failures)

---

- ‚úÖ All ARCHITECT research items documented
- ‚úÖ All epic success criteria defined
- ‚úÖ All deployment checkpoints specified
- ‚úÖ PM reviewed and approved
- ‚úÖ Handed off to ARCHITECT for infrastructure setup and research
