Auto-generates Pages when new Offer is created.

BEHAVIOR:
• Reads all Services and filters by Target Services
• Reads all Locations and filters by Target Locations
• Further filters by Target Branches (via Service Areas)
• Creates 1 Page per Service × Location × Keyword for this Offer
• Validates keywords (min 3 chars, must contain letters)
• Automatically prevents duplicate pages
• Sets all new pages to Status: Draft, Published: false

TARGETING:
• Target Services empty = ALL services
• Target Locations empty = ALL locations
• Target Branches empty = no additional filtering
• Target Branches set = only locations served by those branches

EXAMPLE:
Add "Bathroom Spring Sale" offer
→ Target Services: [Bathroom Remodeling]
→ Target Locations: [ALL]
→ Target Branches: [Medina Office]
→ Creates pages ONLY for Bathroom × Medina Office's locations × all keywords

NOTES:
• Can create 100+ pages depending on targeting
• Handles up to ~750 pages per run (30 second script timeout)
• Skips services with no keywords
• Uses batch creation for performance
